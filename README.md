### My background

#### :baby: The first steps:
- I taught myself programming together with friends when I was at school. We programmed numerous :video_game: games in Unity or Unreal. Even though most of the projects weren't really finished at that time, it was a very instructive time that awakened in me the fun of computer science.

#### :child: The right education
- I was then able to expand and professionalise my knowledge during my studies in media informatics at DÃ¼sseldorf University of Applied Sciences. By learning about conventions and
better procedures, I was able to improve myself further. I was also able to learn how to complete projects as part of a team in numerous projects.
